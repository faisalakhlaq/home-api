# Development Approach

## Working with This Project

### Prerequisites
- Set up development environment (see [Development Setup](./installation.md))
- Familiarize yourself with our branching strategy

### Standard Flow

   git checkout -b feature/your-feature development
   ```

2. **Implement changes**:
   - Adhere to Python style guidelines
   - Maintain test coverage
   - Document new functionality

3. **Validate locally**:
   - Run formatting and linting
   - Execute test suite
   - Verify type hints

4. Create pull request to `development`

5. Address any CI issues or feedback

### Quality Expectations
- Clean, well-structured code
- Meaningful commit messages
- Appropriate test coverage
- Minimal technical debt
- Secure dependency management
